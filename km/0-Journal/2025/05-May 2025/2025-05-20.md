## Parking lot
## Meetings and interactions
- CVC <> Architecture work #projects/tieto_evry_exit_cvc  #areas/contribute_success_IT  #meeting 
	- Architecture is in a journey to empower team and gain speed. The community goes to CVC to inform about progress. Its scope is wider than CVC (10 out of 150 teams)
	- What is important for CVC is that the Value Stream Architects take the best decision, which don't compromise future growth. Reuse of capabilities is key.
		- The architecture community is a communication tool
		- How can we show we do work and collaborate together?
	- Architecture shares everything is reusable in this Value Chain, and that leads to decreased speed. Uniqueness is not as expensive as before.
	- One of the issues seems to be the unclarity about what are we targeting in terms of maturity
		- Maybe Architecture is becoming a proxy for control
	- The root issue seems to be the new levels of autonomy and how the organization is reacting to it
	- [ ] [[Consider how to take the hypothesis about resistance to autonomy]] #projects/onboading
