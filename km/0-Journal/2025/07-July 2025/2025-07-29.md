## Meetings and interactions
- Feedback from interviews with Value Stream Leaders #areas/contribute_success_IT  #meeting 
	- Met [[Laila]]
	- Worked on [[Brief Laila about Value Stream Leaders feedback]]
	- Briefed her on my findings during the interviews with the Value Stream Leaders
	- She wanted to know more about the conversation with [[Magnus Saether Aasjord]]
	- I shared the feedback
	- Noticed I mistakenly classified [[Internet@home Value Stream]] as neutral, where it should have been [[Mobile consumer Value Stream]]
		- Changed the slide
	- Closing the task
- Catch up with [[Ole Christian Enger]] #projects/AI_task_force  #meeting 
	- Met [[Ole Christian Enger]]
	- Worked on [[Co-create presentation about Data, Insight and AI driven Telenor Norway in June]]
	- He seems to be not super happy with the presentation, for some reason
		- He stated we're aligned but the messages are different from the ones he would expect to see
		- He stated, several times, that Bente prefers that context rather than another (coming from him or others)
		- One point, in which he's very right, is that we have mixed too much AI with Data
	- I made some changes to the presentation and will take a second look with [[Ole Christian Enger]]'s lenses
- Salesforce for Business â€“ CCDW migration for TietoEvry Exit #projects/AI_task_force  #meeting 
	- We will need to re-schedule
	- [[Apoorv Shukla]] and [[Milan Purohit]] came but [[Martin Aarseth Karlsen]] didn't. According to [[Apoorv Shukla]], Martin is needed so I need to postpone
- Catch-up #areas/contribute_success_IT  #meeting 
	- Met [[Torbjorn]]
	- [[TietoEvry Exit Program]]
		- The [[Strategy and Transformation Office]] should be contributing with more knowledge. For example, currently there are four system's clusters
			- Customer migration - offering termination -- more driven by business, application owner has not have drive to trigger the migration
			- Going to CVC -- for that, a tight collaboration should happen between the two programs
			- Lift & Shift -- which includes some modernization in specific areas of the systems, but as such they move almost as they're
			- Third-party systems -- which requires coordination with other organizations
		- Giving the responsibility to the system owner will not do it
			- Those are legacy roles
			- These people don't have the influence or power to move this
		- [[Share about what should be our responsibilities in TietoEvry Exit according to Torbjorn]] #projects/tieto_evry_exit_cvc  #person/ludwig #discussion 
	- He would like the [[Strategy and Transformation Office]] to build governance around the Operating Model
		- Two years ago he shared that, together with the [[Vertical Value Stream]] and [[Horizontal Value Stream]], there is need for a function to govern them
		- The governance function should be one that connects the Strategy Process with the execution layer (at team level)
		- One of its missions should be to improve the [[Business Opportunities]] (based on outcomes, short, focus in what and not how)
			- AI may be of help
		- Teams should pull Business Opportunities and declare their contribution, per quarter
			- T-sized contribution effort per quarter 
			- T-sized or numerical value contribution per quarter
		- This becomes a powerful tool to take decisions
			- Can spot over- under-commitment
			- Can help visualizing levels of activity
			- May support dependency mapping
			- This may have a fit with the cadence process 
		- The governance function should set some rules to handle consistency
			- Max effort to commit per team
			- Number of Business Opportunities committed per quarter
			- etcetera
		- Strong suggestion to use AI as agent to automate and accelerate this concept
		- [[Share about the Governance Function idea with Ludwig]] #areas/contribute_success_IT #person/ludwig  #discussion
