## Worked tasks
- Learning on Transformers and its utility in telco
	- [[Transformer Model]], [[Transformer Dataset]], Corpus, Tasks
	- ChatGPT and other GPT-like tools have abstracted a lot of the complexity for making this work with an end user
	- The reality is that Transformers are very task-oriented, like text classification, token classification, question/answers, zero-shot classification, translation, summarization, feature extraction, text generation, fill-mask, sentence similarity, text ranking
	- So when we prompt ChatGPT, there are orchestration activities to figure out what we want, execute tasks in sequence, and then answer
	- For example, if we would like to use AI to help us drafting better [[Business Opportunities]] then we will need to use a pre-trained [[Transformer Dataset]] which understands English ([[BERT]], for example) and another Dataset with training material (examples of good Business Opportunities), and then apply an algorithm to train the model (e.g., SST-2, which is able to classify)
	- A business solution is not straight forward and requires knowledge on the different available options, as well as coding (less) and statistics (less)
