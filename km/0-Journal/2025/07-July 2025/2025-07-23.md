## Worked tasks
- [[Operating Model assessment framework]]
	- Reviewed [[Tor Henrik]]'s changed to the slides
	- My feedback
		- New slide number 22
			- It looks cleaner and easier to read
		- New slide number 21
			- Liked the idea of introducing a new slide to zoom out on the assessment criteria, and give them a better connection with the organization
			- Some wording needs polishing, like "Allocation" which seems to be missing the subject (e.g., competence, funding, etc.)
			- The number of items seems to be still too high, giving the feeling the zoom out is mid way
		- Governance and collaboration slide
			- Probably we can merge the content in "Decision efficiency" and "Faster decisions", or remove the later
		- Should we reduce further the assessment to focus only in "Value Stream organization", hereunder my proposals
			- Customer value/experience
				- First I though to keep it since this is one of the hypothesis behind going for Value Streams
				- I'm now more on the side of removing it, to gain focus
			- Target and prioritizations
				- Remove Clarity on target - is part of organization performance and the Strategy Process
				- Alignment seem to be an important part of the Operating Model - keep it
				- Remove Reallocation as it's part of the company's general Operating Model/Culture 
			- Vertical design and Horizontal design 
				- All seem fine - it's integral part of the Operating Model
			- Value Stream Manageability 
				- This may be a candidate for removal, as we can also consider this as part of the Value Stream empowerment duties
			- Clarity of roles and processes
				- Keep them all - it's integral part of the Operating Model
			- Insight and oversight
				- Remove target-setting and tracking of Value Streams
				- Keep use of shared tracking and collaboration tools - focusing in being able to share and collaborate
			- Decision efficiency
				- Keep them all - key for cross-collaboration 
			- Compliance
				- Considering this is a more decentralized model, compliance becomes more important than before - Keep it
			- Collaboration frequency and quality
				- Keep them all - key for cross-collaboration 
			- Target-setting & Follow-up
				- Keep it - it's part of the new setup
			- Prioritized and predictable resource allocation
				- Keep it - All seem very relevant for the Operating Model
			- Structured and dynamic workforce shaping
				- In doubt: while I believe is integral part of the organization setup and [[P&O division]] should lead it, I'm also aware this is key for the Operating Model
			- Governance and collaboration tools
				- Keep it - Part of the new setup for cross-collaboration
			- Modernization
				- Remove it - Part of Program's and Value Stream goals
			- Work visibility
				- Keep it - Part of cross-collaboration and visibility
			- Employee wellbeing, Continuous Improvement, Modern Mindset workforce, Organizational Debt, Hypothesis validation
				- Keep them
