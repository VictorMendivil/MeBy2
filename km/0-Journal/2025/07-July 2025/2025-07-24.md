## Worked tasks
- [[Be part of the Nordic forum for Technology Strategy]]
	- [[Vidar Vetland]] suggested me to contact [[Eyvinn Aarrestad]]
	- He is coming back from vacations on August 4th, so moving the task for the day after
- [[Envision a plan for CVC]]
	- No feedback from [[Ludwig]] yet
- Read Beyond the hype: Capturing the potential of AI and gen AI in tech, media, and telecom
	- [[Beyond The Hype Capturing The Potential Of AI And Gen AI In Tech, Media, And Telecom]]
	- Highlights
		- new gen AI use cases are expected to unleash between $380 billion and $690 billion in impact—$60 billion to $100 billion in telecommunications
		- The largest share of total impact will likely be in customer care and sales, which together would account for approximately 70 percent of total impact;
		- In 2012, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) estimated that knowledge workers spent about a fifth of their time, or one day each workweek, searching for and gathering information. If generative AI could take on such tasks, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the workers doing them, the benefits would be huge
		- Crucially, productivity and quality of service improved most among less-experienced agents, while the AI assistant did not increase— and sometimes decreased—the productivity and quality metrics of more highly skilled agents
		- Global economic growth was slower from 2012 to 2022 than in the two preceding decades.12 Although the COVID-19 pandemic was a signifi cant factor, long-term structural challenges— including declining birth rates and aging populations—are ongoing obstacles to growth.
		- Productivity, which measures output relative to input, or the value of goods and services produced divided by the amount of labor, capital, and other resources required to produce them, was the main engine of economic growth in the three decades from 1992 to 2022
	- Closing task
