- Technical CoP
	- Decision - choose one relevant for me
		- Should do we move away from TietoEvry mainframe services even though we haven't finished to migrate out of all of them on time (end of 2026)
			- Explaining the context 
			- Include risks, and explain why is not possible to play with experimentation
			- Utilize Thinking Out Loud 
				- Consider how to deal with believers of the impossible
				- Reverse the ownership: make people input content themselves
			- I intent to is an interesting technique, although not applicable at this moment
			- Use Architecture CoP as advisory sound board
			- 6-pager can be used to bring everything together
				- Maybe for the conclusion on Plan B?
			- A [[Nominal Group Technique (NGT)]] can be useful
		- Principles
			- Taking back MWB: Transforming to a future fit Telenor
			- Incorporate: improve negotiation position either with incumbent or new vendor
			- Cost position should be less that today's
		- Pitfalls
			- Bias towards a solution already
			- Forgetting that not deciding is a decision
## Meetings and interactions
- Experience sharing - Posten’s mainframe modernisation journey #areas/learning  #meeting 
	- Met [[Siri Wam]], [[Arne Berntzen]]
	- Mainframe competence is scarce in the market
	- Approach was to change the technology without transforming business processes. It was a technology transformation.
	- Transformation was managed following an agile approach. Extensive evidence of short feedback loops and modularity.
	- Assessed two options: rewrite code to be modern or migrate code with automation tools. Preferred first option because they could take full advantage of the benefits of the Cloud (in terms of performance, scalability and cost)
	- The new system was build next to the old, synchronizing data between both. That allowed them to continuously validate their new developments, which 	- were hitting production continuously.
		- Started changing inbound integrations. There were data quality thresholds which, once reached, allowed them to switch the integration from the old system to the new one.
		- Moved to outbound integrations after all inbound were ready.
		- Moved interface by interface, API by API. Very regimental: move one, measure, accept, move to the next.
		- Data was synchronized on real time between the systems
	- Performance was as good as before (actually, 36% better, as the metrics suggested)
	- Three-years project, ranging from 70 to 100 FTE, mainly driven externally (only 5 to 7 internal).
	- TCS was the partner selected to execute
	- Even though the project was top priority for the company, the team needed to elbow their way every day to preserve that priority when executing.
	- Cost reduction proven of 70%, with less cost sensitivity to increases of demand/volume
	- Reduced vulnerability to operational issues and improved availability
	- Reduced freezing periods (from 100 days to 15 days)
		- Technology backbone: microservices, observability platform, modular approach
	- Once the organization was able to have all data connected, it started to deploy an observability platform, which is allowing realtime monitoring, because system's data is more accurate than their machine's sensors.
	- Using DataBricks for data insights
- DIAI-Value, challenges, and roadmap #projects/AI_task_force  #meeting 
	- Met [[Sajjad]] and [[Bente]]
	- Worked on [[Connect with Sajjad on the commercial ambitions for data, insights and AI]]
	- There are issues on customer retention and we don't know because lack of visibility on data
		- Fix: we should be able to understand our issues in order to digitalize customer experience
		- Network: we should understand our availability
	- We're costly due to big workforce - we should increase our productivity
	- Slide 14: it looks like a lot of challenges
		- They seem to be two big buckets: governance and legacy
		- Data is fragmented
		- Should do we exemplify some of our challenges?
	- Slide with centralized / distributed
		- It supports better the reader if the transition happens from left to right, and not from top to bottom
	- We need strong commitment and cascaded communication to the line organization
		- Maybe we're missing a success factor slide?
- Areas for improvement based on feedback #projects/AI_task_force  #meeting 
	- Met [[Melinda Holgrem]]
	- Worked on [[Define better the challenge with Value Stream Leadership]]
	- Melinda picked topic Value Stream Leaders
		- ![[IMG_0595.jpg]]
		- We were discussing if change in leadership behaviors was feasible. It may be but only with the right sponsorship.
		- There seems to be two potential causes for the issue
			- Skills: more digital skills are needed; telco skills may not be as dominant 
			- Ambitions: do we have a transformational ambition? are we able to reimagining the business?
		- Skills cannot be acquired overnight; they will grow with maturity, over time. Do we have the time to develop those skills?
		- We would need help from HR on this topic, but first, the below
		- We need data to probe this is an issue, and where, and why
		- In the meantime, we can try exploring this with [[Torbjorn]] and [[Ludwig]]. While we may not be able to present metrics, we can already explore their position
		- [x] [[Brief quickly Ludwig on the topic of VS Leadership]] #areas/contribute_success_IT #discussion #person/ludwig ✅ 2025-08-07
		- [/] [[Value Stream Leadership improvements]] #areas/contribute_success_IT
	- Melinda picked on Tech Leaders resistance to IT strategy
		- She would like to connect in August for DORA metrics
		- What do we need to measure so we can have leading indicators for deviations on IT strategy?
			- Most likely City Plan (Guiding Principles and Guardrails are key)
