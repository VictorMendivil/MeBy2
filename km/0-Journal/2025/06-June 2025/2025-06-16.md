## Parking lot
- Email from [[Ludwig]], asking to collect our thoughts around Q3
	- Inputs
		* 1. Gather our thoughts collectively as a team until EoD Wednesday June 18th
		* 2. Align them with Birgitte in my 1:1 with her on Friday 20th
		* 3. Finalize together with all of you on Thursday 26th in our Q3 priorities session
		* I was thinking a similar format as we used during the Q2 review in a shared file [@Emma Hartland](mailto:emma.hartland@telenor.no) could you potentially set that up?
		* Then we all can add priorities that we see the team should have in Q3. If you are able to T-shirt size them (S = 10-20% of one persons time; M = 20-50% of one persons time; L = 50-100% of one persons time; XL = more than 100% of one persons time) it makes it easier to form a holistic picture in my head ðŸ˜Š Feel free to think independently from yourself and add priorities for the team. What we decide to take on and how we distribute it amongst ourselves I think we can discuss on the 26th.
