## Worked tasks
### Worked on drafting invite to meet Value Stream Leaders regarding identifying value of using data insights, AI, and cross-Value Stream data

^4ef760

* Ideas
	* Target: Value Stream Leaders
	* Trigger: appeal to their need to consume data, use shared platforms and competence to deliver committed value through the business opportunities. To satisfy that need, other Value Streams must be activated and connected.
	* The ask: identify which Business Opportunities in their portfolio are having a strong reliance on data analytics/insights, cross value stream data, or automation through AI.
* My conclusion
	Dear [Value Stream Leaders],
	As Value Streams increasingly rely on shared data platforms, cross-stream data, and specialized competencies to achieve our company targets, it is essential to identify key dependencies, priorities, value generation, and expectations early on. To facilitate this, we would like to initiate a dialogue with you and will schedule a meeting in the coming weeks.
	To ensure a productive discussion, we kindly ask you to review your portfolio and highlight Business Opportunities or activities that heavily depend on:
	- Data analytics and insights,
	- Data originating from outside your Value Stream,
	- AI-driven automation.
	Your input will help us better align support and resources. Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to your insights.
* Asked [[Bente]] if she is fine with me sending it. Basically because the Value Stream Leaders may think this is coming from the TMO, while it's really coming from the Value Stream
