## Reflections
* Found some good candidates in the list, especially on secondary areas which we can try out without hurting the core business, like Streamix, and device insurance (due to dynamic pricing)
* It seems some business areas in consumer are eager to change to dynamic billing and pricing
* We decided to stop scouting the Business Opportunities for now, and focus in understanding business (especially around Entertainment)

	* Customers choose [[Matrixx]] because it was more modern, and probably cheaper. Today they are struggling to get the most out of the platform due to business resistance.
	* We would like to engage with [[IT Cloud Platforms]] as they are offering [[Nova]] 
		* No answer

	* Use cases
		* Identify SIMs which are dormant/active, because they are a cost for Telenor, and also because it can be a capability to offer
		- Differentiate traffic types
		- Configure what type of networks we're supporting (4G / 5G)
		- Move prices from subscription to agreement
			- E.g. Organization buying total capacity
			- E.g. Subscribe a bundle of X SIM Cards
			- E.g., Buy individual 5G features
		- Extended service to install or support SIM cards
		- Buy network slice
		- Access to RAN data - what can do we do?
		- Self-service

	- I can arrange talks with consultancy firms or [[Matrixx]] to learn from other telcos' experiences. This will help us understand what works and what doesn't.
		- I suggest we invite [[Jesper Lade]] to these talks
	- We can consider assigning some service design capabilities or commercial expertise to [[Jesper Lade]], to start defining what the needs are
	- For now, let's:
		- Consider a small MVP to prove value when we are clearer about the needs
		- Keep technical discussions light while use cases are still being shaped – but inform Value Streams about what we’re doing
		- Stay flexible on whether we build this before or during customer deployment
	- I suggest we hold off on workshops until the business direction is clearer. This way, we can be more effective when we do bring people together.
