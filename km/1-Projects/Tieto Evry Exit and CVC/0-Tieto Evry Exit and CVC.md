## Overview
* Both programs are fundamental for modernization and reduce security risks attached to current infrastructure. Exiting TietoEvry and [[CVC]] will reduce operational expenditure, as far as a radical simplification of both, process and technology, happens.
## Goals
Two projects in one here. 
* For Tieto Evry Exit, work as IT Advise to 1) ensure feasibility of plan and timelines, 2) ensure future solution is sound, 3) work on more technology strategic aspects
* For CVC, work with [[IT Architecture]] to make sure there is an Architecture Framework for the program

## Reflections
* For TietoEvry Exit, our current agreement is to have me as an IT advisor, with the following responsibility
	* I will focus is key areas
	* Assess options and feasibility
	* Surface dilemmas, pros/cons
	* Connect value streams if there is a gap
* For CVC, our agreement is for me to focus in:
	* Architecture Framework
	* Mainframe migration - I need to define more what is this
	* Account for the target systems - make sure they are sustainable and fitting the future 
* There is no Business Opportunity for neither Tieto Evry Exit nor CVC
* 7 mainframe systems to exit
	* [[deFakto system]]
	* [[Marius system]]
	* [[Nitra system]]
	* [[NUFS system]]
	* [[SVIT system]]
	* [[Telsis AS system]]
	* [[Telsis LK system]]
