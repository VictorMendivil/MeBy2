## Reflections
* There is an issue in the Salesforce - CCDW space, for which architects have been unable to commit to dates or work
* There are integrations coming towards Salesforce, and going out of Salesforce
* For the ones coming towards Salesforce, it was decided to use [[CCDW system]] as the source for information. The issue with the decision is that the Salesforce team doesn't know what are the real sources for the information
* Going forward, Salesforce will need to reconciliate different sources of information, and the customer may not have the same data structure
* 2025-05-06
	* Almost all Value Streams are going to finalize the sign-off by beginning of June, while [[Mobile business Value Stream]] remains undecided
