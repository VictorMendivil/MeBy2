## Reflections
* For future feedback
	* How do we drive cross-Value Stream initiatives
	* What about governance of things which are cross-Value Stream, like capacity allocation, priorities, resource allocation, etc.
	* Would it be possible to use more of the Value Streams when we're running a program across? (rather than getting a layer of control on top)
	* How do we deal with functions which are not part of the Value Stream setup? and with areas which are neither functions nor Value Streams? (E.g., Billing)
	* How do we connect with aggregation areas built in the divisions to coordinate efforts in their Value Streams? (e.g., Consumer Strategy coordinating data opportunities across Consumer Value Streams)
