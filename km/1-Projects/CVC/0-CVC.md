* Zero touch and automation goals
	* Based on this presentation: [CVC Advisory Board 20250702 - Translated.pptx](https://telenorgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/personal/victor_mendivil_telenor_no/Documents/1-Projects/CVC/CVC%20Advisory%20Board%2020250702%20-%20Translated.pptx?d=w2417fdaa396b49729ea86fa7f9d9bdc9&csf=1&web=1&e=A9heWd)
	* The material achieves to make it more concrete the general goals on Zero-touch and automation
	* I'm under the impression more automation can be achieved. For example, systems acting on our behalf, rather than simplifying systems for use.
		* A general thread is to try moving work to less expensive function (e.g., Customer Service, however that also represent a cost), instead of consider how to highly automate it
	* Related to contractors, the focus should be in either removing work, or shifting it to the customer. Today's propose to shift work to contractors will generate extra costs on their side, which, most likely, may end up with us
	* I'm unsure as to how are we going to achieve a common value chain with our current [[Architecture CoP]] setup
	* There is a theme on preparing better for visits. I'm unsure if the issues of going unprepared to the visits are related to data quality, inefficient systems, etc., or a lack of preparation efforts (mindset) from the technical areas
