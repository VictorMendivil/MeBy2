## Reflections
* Related to [[Safe and worryfree Value Stream]]
* PROS
	* They have done some modernization and it's still challenging to continue, although is manageable
	* Developed the [[HERO]] product as part of [[CVC]]
	* They're promoter of the way of working ([[0-VDOM 2_plus]]) and [[IT P&C]]
	* Very important to have Technical Leaders and the Value Stream Architecture
* Room for improvement
	* Challenges to get access to some systems, but not big issues so far
	* Discovering some issues to get hold on data, but still don't have a conclusion. They're very busy.
	* It takes time to get used to work in [[0-VDOM 2_plus]]
	* Clarify and be able to broad roles, so the team doesn't need to always add capacity
