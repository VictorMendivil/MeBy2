## Reflections
* Related to [[Mobile business Value Stream]]
- How satisfied are you with the services provided by the Value Streams owned by IT?
	* Satisfied with the digital workplace, although wondering why do we need to decommission some of the great tools available, like Mural
	* Channel tools are dragging us. It was our decision to postpone modernization.
	* It is difficult to handle the priorities between growth and modernization
	* In [[BSS]] we have opportunities to modernize. Event-driven architecture is a big progress and opportunity for us.
	* Network. Happy to see steps in the right direction, with network as a service. Good signs.
	* Unfortunately, when we created buffers during growth or modernization, we decided not to use them to modernize, losing the opportunity. Example: after a business improvement which made 1 or 2 headcounts redundant, we reported a saving, rather than using the improvement to invest in modernization
- How satisfied are you with the capacity and competence provided by the IT P&C, and your relationship with this area
	* In general the development competence is good, when we get them
	* Long time to fill gaps hiring people. He hints the future downsizing may be the issue (in his view)
	* Large competence variations between teams (e.g., Nova is cutting-edge and Analytics is improving since last year)
	* It's not IT's fault not to have enough capacity in the Value Streams. Redistributing capacity is old-fashion and doesn't allow for rapid reallocation.
	* Maybe if IT costs would be in the Value Streams, it would be better because then the Value Stream Leaders will be able to defend headcounts with the Business Opportunities. Headcount reductions in IT can harm more the business.
- How likely are you to recommend the IT setup, from a scale from 0 to 10?
	* 6 to 7. He's not a detractor
	* The divisional structure doesn't help.
	* In general, there are many people in the horizontals. More balancing is needed. 
	* Also, from an accountability point of view, the verticals are limited (e.g., Salesforce)
	* He is not detractor of [[Value Driven Operating Model (VDOM)]] but more can be done

		* How have they done the downsizing and still grow the business?
