## Reflections
* About the role description and focus
	* Role description has been created, with review by [[Tone]], [[Tor Henrik]], [[Kristoffer Karud]], [[Ragnar]], [[Emma]], [[John Gustav]], [[Sajjad]]
	* Only one pending point, coming from [[Tone]], as is it reflect a responsibility to safeguard the sustainability and feasibility of the future solution
	* Together with [[Ragnar]], we have agreed on a priority, with the following order
		* Liaison IT/Transformation
		* [[0-Tieto Evry Exit and CVC]]
		* [[0-Billing]]
		* [[0-AI Task Force]]
		* [[0-VDOM 2_plus]]
	* As it stands now, I feel I still need a stronger alignment with the [[Strategy and Transformation Office]] before presenting it to [[IT division]]
* 2025-05-02
	* Considering I've been here for three months, this is time for me to ramp-down this project and move forward
	* I still have some way to go for interviewing all Value Streams. Does it make sense to do it all?
	* I should considering making a clustering of my findings when interviewing the non-IT Value Streams, specially finding strengths and improvement areas
	* I must present my priorities and role description to IT 
	* Are my priorities changing after my interviews with the Value Stream Leaders?
	* I should share the Initial Assessment document with the [[Strategy and Transformation Office]]
### Areas to address
* Leadership - transformation skills, willingness, motivation - [[Value Stream Leadership improvements]]
* IT execution misalignment with IT strategy - [[Tech Leadership excellence]]
* 
* Lack of time to learn and develop (coming from [[Laila]], [[Melinda Holgrem]])
* Sovereign datacenter / data in red zone
* Slow hiring / onboarding in [[IT P&C]]
* Lack of ownership on data literacy, competence definition and competence building
* Value Stream Architects not satisfied with role clarity
* Technical Leaders - leadership skills for motivating personnel, resilience, etc.
* Managing Technical Debt 
* Citizen development
* Sustainability and GHG - focus in devices can yield more benefits
* Focus on reducing unit prices for Salesforce
* Chargeback model for Salesforce - increasing consumer accountability
