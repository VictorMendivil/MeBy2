- [[Hardware Sales and Solutions Value Stream]], [[Stian Syvertsen]]
- How satisfied are you with the capacity and competence provided by the IT P&C, and your relationship with this area
	- Already staffed all capacity and competence from IT. The process is quick and accurate.
	- Good relationship with the IT P&C.
	- In turn, it's more difficult to increase capacity on the business side.
	- There is good connection between goals and teams.
	- The challenge is Business Opportunity process, which prioritizes transformation above running business (or business as usual)
		- [[NOL]] sees more the Business Opportunities than the running business, and that is especially true for sales channels.
		- Sales channels, in similar fashion than horizontal Value Streams, are asked to reduce costs, however they're enablers for the growth promised by the Product teams in Vertical Value Streams
		- The Business Opportunity process should consider how to integrate running the business 
- How satisfied are you with the services provided by the Value Streams owned by IT?
	- Satisfied with Value Stream Architect
	- They are aware of the IT Value Streams. Examples: they know about Geneva (for billing), or OneView
	- However, they are not aware of Shared Data Services
- How likely are you to recommend the IT setup, from a scale from 0 to 10?
	- Tending between neutral and positive
	- Positive due to the high level of integration of IT people into the Value Stream
	- Neutral because the IT owned Value Streams are not proactive enough
