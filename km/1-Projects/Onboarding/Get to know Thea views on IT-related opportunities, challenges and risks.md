## Reflections
* Related to [[Assurance Value Stream]]
- How satisfied are you with the services provided by the Value Streams owned by IT?
	* There are two main apps they care about
		* [[Octo system]]
		* [[Alfa app]]
		* [[Authority Request system]]
	* They seems to be satisfied with the digital landscape available to them
	* Private Cloud is an area of concern
- How satisfied are you with the capacity and competence provided by the IT P&C, and your relationship with this area
	* They are very satisfied with the collaboration with [[IT P&C]]. There is good dialogue.
	* Seems to be happy, in general. 
	* We can improve on functions. E.g., system ownership; legacy apps which are cross Value Stream. IT would like to move personnel to the Value Stream, but still people will need to serve several Value Streams
	* Interesting learning: [[Marius system]] takes a long term view on capacity allocation, which pays in good dialogue and proactiveness towards [[IT P&C]]. It works really well.
- How likely are you to recommend the IT setup, from a scale from 0 to 10?
	* Promoter (9 or 10)
	* They believe the model works great due to flexibility/mobility and competence available
		* Flexibility example: a person lost his/her security clearance and was replaced rather fast
	* Maybe improvable: most dependable leaders reporting to Value Stream. However, it may not work
