## Reflections
 - How satisfied are you with the outcomes provided by the Value Streams owned by IT?
	- Other VS are black boxes - there is little information
	- Very few common arenas for sharing
	- It could be valuable for them to have a regular presentation on what is going on with the operating model (maybe some opportunities they don't know about)
	- They believe they need to do everything themselves
	- It seems there is value in getting more in contact with other Value Streams
	- 
- How satisfied are you with the capacity and competence provided by the IT P&C, and your relationship with this area
	- It was difficult to have the dialogue and get the necessary people
	- Lack of IT needs
	- A few months afterwards, the competence is coming
	- We're almost covered with roles
	- Is looking good now
	- There is competition for the IT capacity within the Value Stream as well
	- Recruitment process has been transparent
	- Good relationship with IT P&C
	- In terms of competence it's ok
		- In some teams (especially the ones from Telenor Labs) have difficulties communicating
		- They're expecting IT will help balancing the allocation of the people coming from Telenor Labs
		- Example: allocation in OneView - which is quite key, only have 2 
		- [ ] Reflect on the above - key systems (Telenor ID)
	- Very few people are equipped with AI skills
	- There is the expectation that P&C functions connect and have dialogue
		- Who gives the performance feedback? is not easy to give feedback for some IT people who have not worked closely with us
	- Dilemma between modernization versus growth
	- No one seems to be seeing the totality for our customer or systems - 
* How likely are you to recommend the current IT setup on a scale from 0 to 10?
	* Given that we don't have any escalation, they are not dissatisfied
	* There could be more contact. More guidance and advisory.
	* 7 to 8
	* Neutral
		* Coaches didn't work as expected
