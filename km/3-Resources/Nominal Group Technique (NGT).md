- Useful technique to come to decisions as a group
- The Nominal Group Technique (NGT) is ==a structured method for group brainstorming that encourages participation from all members and helps reach a prioritized decision==. It's designed to minimize the influence of dominant personalities and ensure that everyone has a chance to contribute their ideas. NGT is particularly useful when a group needs to quickly generate and evaluate ideas, make decisions, or solve problems. 
- Here's a breakdown of the process: 
	1. **Silent Idea Generation:** Each participant independently writes down their ideas on a given topic.
	2. **Round-Robin Sharing:** Ideas are shared one at a time, in a round-robin fashion, and recorded without discussion.
	3. **Clarification and Discussion:** The group discusses each idea for clarity, but without debating or criticizing.
	4. **Preliminary Voting:** Each participant ranks or votes on the ideas.
	5. **Final Ranking:** The group tallies the scores to prioritize the ideas.
