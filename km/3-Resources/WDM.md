WDM stands for Wavelength Division Multiplexing.
A technology that allows multiple optical signals to be transmitted simultaneously over a single fiber optic cable by using different wavelengths (colors) of light. DWDM (Dense WDM) can carry dozens or even hundreds of separate channels, dramatically increasing the capacity of fiber networks.
