- MCP stands for Model Context Protocol
- The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. The architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.
- Today, we're introducing three major components of the Model Context Protocol for developers:
	- The Model Context Protocol [specification and SDKs](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)
	- Local MCP server support in the [Claude Desktop apps](https://claude.ai/download)
	- An [open-source repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) of MCP servers
