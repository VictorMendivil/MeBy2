The first phase involves defining objectives and frameworks as part of the annual Strategy Process. Once objectives and business opportunities are set, the IT organization assesses capacity allocation based on the upcoming year's direction. If capacity and competence demand do not align with the current pool, dilemmas may need to be managed or escalated. By the end of Q3, a general allocation plan is accepted by IT and stakeholders. Afterwards it is communicated to “Management” and Value Stream leadership.

To make this allocation more data-driven, a task force is working to define an allocation model that clarifies how to maximize value creation when deploying existing capacity. This work is planned to be finished as an integrated part of the strategy process this year’s summer.

Once the capacity is allocated, the Value Streams are empowered to optimize it based on their internal prioritization, and it’s an ongoing dialogue between Value Streams and [[IT P&C]]. The capacity is relatively constant, indicating a low appetite for increasing headcounts, typically through consultants (paid by [[IT P&C]] through Opex & Capex and allocated to the Value Stream).

It is worth noting there was an instance where a division demanded more capacity from the IT organization, which was not available. Despite the capacity being already allocated, the IT organization was expected to deliver on the request, which they did by reducing allocation on their own Value Streams, in turn increasing operational risks.

Finally, the teams seem to be relatively stable in terms of team members, although this is based on shared perspectives rather than concrete evidence.
