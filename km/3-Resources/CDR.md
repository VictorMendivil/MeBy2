- Stands for Call Detail Record (CDR)
- It's a data record produced by a telephone exchange or other telecommunications equipment that contains detailed information about a specific communication event, such as a phone call, SMS message, or data session.
- Think of it as a **digital receipt or log entry** for every single communication activity that takes place within a network.
