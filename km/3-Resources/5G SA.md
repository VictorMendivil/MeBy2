**5G Standalone (5G SA)**Â is a mode of deploying 5G networks where both the radio access network (RAN) and the core network are entirely based on 5G technology. In this setup, 5G devices connect directly to a 5G network end-to-end, without relying on any legacy 4G (LTE) infrastructure.

**Key characteristics of 5G Standalone:**

- Uses a new [[5G Core]] instead of the 4G core (EPC).
- Delivers the full potential of 5G features: ultra-low latency, high speed, network slicing, and support for massive IoT.
- Enables advanced capabilities like network slicing and edge computing.
