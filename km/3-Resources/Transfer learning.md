#resources/knowledge 

- It's a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is adapted and reused for a related task, rather than training a new model from scratch.
- The core idea is that knowledge gained from solving one problem can be transferred to help solve a different but related problem. This is similar to how humans apply skills learned in one domain to new situations - for example, knowing how to ride a bicycle helps when learning to ride a motorcycle.
