> What are the core technologies of 5G?  
    The core technologies of 5G include Network Slicing, which allows for multiple virtual networks on a single physical infrastructure; Massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) for increased capacity and efficiency; and [[mmWave]] technology, offering high-frequency bands for greater speed and capacity. Additionally, 5G employs advanced technologies like beamforming for improved signal direction and strength, and [Edge Computing](https://www.supermicro.com/en/glossary/edge-computing) for reduced latency.
