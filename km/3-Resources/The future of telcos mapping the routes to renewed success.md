## Document Note
Key fundamental challenges:
1. Legacy business model may not produce sufficient profitability and return to sustain the required level of capital investment.
2. New technologies and regulations are bringing more competition (e-SIM, wholesale, etc.)
3. Macroeconomic uncertainty may drive a growing wave of regulatory interventions. (e.g., data protection framework, regulated price increases, etc.)

Three options:
1. Reinventing the integrated telco business and operating model
2. Boost efficiency and effectiveness (including redesigning the operating model, from scratch)
3. Pursue growth at scale. Looking for business beyond the core in B2C and B2B

Redesigning the operating model. Telcos can begin to lay a new, streamlined foundation for success with a comprehensive, digital-driven redesign of the entire operating model.

Telcos can leverage granular user data to make individualized plan and device recommendations, promos, and other outreach
