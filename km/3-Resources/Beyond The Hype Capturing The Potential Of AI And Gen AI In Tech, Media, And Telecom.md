## Highlights

New gen AI use cases are expected to unleash between $380 billion and $690 billion in impact—$60 billion to $100 billion in telecommunications

The largest share of total impact will likely be in customer care and sales, which together would account for approximately 70 percent of total impact;

In 2012, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) estimated that knowledge workers spent about a fifth of their time, or one day each workweek, searching for and gathering information. If generative AI could take on such tasks, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the workers doing them, the benefits would be huge

Crucially, productivity and quality of service improved most among less-experienced agents, while the AI assistant did not increase— and sometimes decreased—the productivity and quality metrics of more highly skilled agents

Global economic growth was slower from 2012 to 2022 than in the two preceding decades.12 Although the COVID-19 pandemic was a significant factor, long-term structural challenges— including declining birth rates and aging populations—are ongoing obstacles to growth.

Productivity, which measures output relative to input, or the value of goods and services produced divided by the amount of labor, capital, and other resources required to produce them, was the main engine of economic growth in the three decades from 1992 to 2022

Risks have already surfaced, including concerns about the content that generative AI systems produce: Will they infringe upon intellectual property due to “plagiarism” in the training data used to create foundation models? Will the answers that LLMs produce when questioned be accurate, and can they be explained? Will the content that generative AI creates be fair or biased in ways that users do not want by, say, producing content that reflects harmful stereotypes?
