- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an important AI technique that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)
- What RAG Is:
	- A method that combines information retrieval with text generation
	- A way to give LLMs access to external, up-to-date knowledge
	- A technique to make AI responses more accurate and reliable
- The key advantage of RAG is that it helps overcome one of the main limitations of traditional LLMs - their reliance on potentially outdated training data. By retrieving current information at runtime, RAG systems can provide more accurate and up-to-date responses while maintaining the natural language capabilities of the base model.
- Think of RAG like a student taking an open-book exam: instead of relying solely on memorized information (like traditional LLMs), the system can "look up" relevant information in reliable sources before formulating its response.
