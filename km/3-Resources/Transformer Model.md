- It is a neural network architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequences of data in parallel rather than step-by-step. It can simultaneously examine all parts of an input sequence and determine which elements are most relevant to each other.
- The key innovation is the attention mechanism, which allows the model to "attend to" or focus on different parts of the input when processing each element. This makes transformers highly effective at understanding context and relationships in data.
