- Semantic management is a sophisticated approach to organizing and handling information and knowledge within organizations.
- Definition
	- A set of practices and technologies that focus on managing information based on its meaning (semantics) rather than just its structure
	- An approach that helps classify and connect content so knowledge can be easily accessed, understood, and transformed
- Semantic management is particularly valuable in today's data-rich environment because it helps organizations not just store information, but understand it, connect it, and make it more accessible and useful for various purposes. It's like creating a smart library where not only is everything organized, but the relationships between different pieces of information are understood and can be navigated intelligently.
