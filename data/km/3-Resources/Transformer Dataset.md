- It is a collection of data specifically prepared and formatted for training or fine-tuning transformer neural network models.
- **Common types**
	- **Pre-training datasets** contain massive amounts of unlabeled text for learning general language patterns. Examples include Common Crawl, Wikipedia dumps, and books corpora.
	- **Fine-tuning datasets** are smaller, task-specific collections with input-output pairs for supervised learning, like question-answering pairs or classification examples.
	- **Instruction datasets** contain prompts and desired responses for training models to follow instructions, popular in modern language model development.
