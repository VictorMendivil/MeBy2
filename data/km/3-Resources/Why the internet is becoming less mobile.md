## Highlights

- A quarter of a century on from the launch of 3G networks, and 18 years on from the launch of the iPhone, mobile networks carry only 13% of IP traffic, and this share is entering a period of decline.
- One should think of mobile networks as fallback networks
- The cities where Verizon recorded the highest mobile usage in the USA are all poorer than average, and vice versa.
- The lowest mobile usage per household and the lowest growth rates in China are to be found in the richer regions.
