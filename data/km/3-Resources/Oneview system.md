#resources/app 

- ID S07251
- Is a customer care system. The system is used by customer service and dealers. Both internal and external resellers and customer service agents have access to OneView, but to different degrees.
- The goal of OneView is to build an interface for all served channels on top of existing self-service APIs. Over time, OneView has gradually taken over from systems such as [[OFM system]] and [[KAS system]].
- Since OneView is an interface that will eventually be used to manage all aspects of a customer relationship, there will naturally be a lot of processing of data in this application.
