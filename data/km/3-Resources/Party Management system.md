* ID: S07411
* The main purpose for party management is to keep an overview of our customers, without going into details of accounts and subscriptions. It supports both person and organizations. The main entry point to the data are a set of APIs and the main source of information is the CDC database. 
* There is a close connection between [[Party Management system]] and [[Party Register system]], one would also say it has some overlap, but the main differentiator is this: In [[Party Register system]] we have an overview of all persons and organizations, but in [[Party Management system]] we only have those that are customers of [[Telenor Norway]].
