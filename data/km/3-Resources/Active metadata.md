- Active Metadata is a modern approach to metadata management that goes beyond traditional static metadata. Here's a comprehensive explanation:
- Definition:
	- A dynamic, automated approach to metadata management
	- Real-time collection and processing of metadata across data ecosystems
	- An intelligent system that makes metadata actionable and automated
- Active Metadata represents a shift from traditional static metadata to a more dynamic, automated approach. Instead of just describing data, it actively participates in data management processes, enabling automation, providing insights, and driving better decision-making. Think of it as a "living" system that continuously learns and evolves with your data ecosystem, rather than a static "card catalog" of information about your data.
