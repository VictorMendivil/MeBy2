- It's a blueprint to build flexible (composable) cloud-based telco and enterprise IT systems.
- Provides the foundation for telco's to simplify enterprise architecture designs, modernize, and plug & play systems (including network)
- My reflection
	- The Business Architecture model seems, at first sight, big. However, it's repetitive per vertical aspect, which makes the model easier
	- Process-heavy, and very little on collaboration or agility 
	- There is merit in building a common understanding of the organization, terminologies, what goes where, etc.
	- However, for an organization to document and design that way, it will be very difficult. Not only for the number of architecture roles needed, but also because the understanding of the framework should be very high all around; finally, discipline is the biggest huddle.
