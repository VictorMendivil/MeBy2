- **NMS** stands for **Network Management System**.
- An NMS is a software platform or suite of tools used to monitor, maintain, and manage network infrastructure. Its main functions include:
	- **Monitoring network devices:** Such as routers, switches, servers, and base stations.
	- **Fault management:** Detecting, logging, and notifying network problems or outages.
	- **Performance management:** Tracking metrics like bandwidth usage, latency, and error rates.
	- **Configuration management:** Managing device settings and pushing updates or changes.
	- **Provisioning:** Adding, updating, or removing network devices or services.- 
- NMS is often a key component of the broader [[OSS]] in telco environments, helping network operators ensure optimal performance, reliability, and service quality.
