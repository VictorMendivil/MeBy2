- Delegation is the act of giving the power to accomplish a goal to a person under your leadership (part of the line organization or a [[Cross-functional team]])
- There are different "scopes" which can be delegated, hereunder from smaller to bigger responsibility
	- Tasks
	- Projects
	- Functions
	- Goals
- Assigning a scope depends on the level of trust, seniority, career path, interests and responsibility of the individual. Bigger scopes typically require more level of trust and seniority
- The best delegation happens when people pull goals, rather than being pushed. However, it requires more seniority from the individuals.
- Some of the goals and functions will be perceived as not directed towards anyone in particular, or a general goal (i.e., create a framework to measure value). High chances are that no-one picks those goals, as people are always eager to pick highly-related goals for themselves, but not eager when it comes to general goals.
	- In these cases a pushier approach may be required, otherwise the leader will need to keep the goal and delete smaller scopes to the individuals 
- Delegation has levels depending on how the leader would like to keep decision rights, or play an advisory role; some typical levels are, from the point of view of the leader
	- Tell - I will tell them my decision
	- Sell - I will sell my decision to them
	- Consult - I will consult and then decide
	- Agree - We will agree together
	- Advise - I will advise but they decide
	- Inquire - I will enquire after they decide
	- Delegate - I will fully delegate
- It serves quite well to be very explicit in the delegation, and to agree before giving the goal away. Hereunder a simple framework
	- Purpose: depending on the scope, be directional or very precise
	- Timeline: important to set expectations and, sometimes, also drive urgency.
		- However, driving urgency can be done in other different ways
	- Feedback loops: intentionally setup how often the leader would like to be briefed on progress
	- Measurement: clarity as to what is expected. It should be easy to implement and measure
