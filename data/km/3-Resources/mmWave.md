## What is millimeter wave (mmWave)?

Millimeter wave (mmWave), also known as millimeter band, is a range of electromagnetic frequencies between microwaves and infrared. Its frequency spectrum is used for wireless high-speed communications. It is also known as the extremely high frequency, or EHF, band by the International Telecommunication Union.

One of the predominant uses of mmWaves is for [5G](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/5G). Communications based on this [band](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/band) of frequencies are fast and provide increased bandwidth, making it ideal for network carriers to provide faster service to bandwidth-intensive applications. The mmWave band contains [wavelengths](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/wavelength) between 10 millimeters at 30 gigahertz and 1 millimeter at 300 GHz.

Millimeter wave is the band of frequencies between 30 and 300 GHz.

When used for 5G signals, mmWaves are produced using small, low-power cells called [small cells](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/small-cell). Small cells are deployed as a network in clusters to provide acceptable coverage in an area.

Because of the high frequency of mmWaves, they have a limited range. And because of this limited range, 5G also uses lower-frequency bands called Sub-6 5G, which aren't in the mmWave range. Sub-6 5G is still typically faster than average 4G [LTE](https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/definition/Long-Term-Evolution-LTE) speeds.
