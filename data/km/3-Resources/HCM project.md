#resources 

* Project led by [[Telenor group]]
* [[Kjetil Selst√∏ Hatlehol]] represents [[Telenor Norway]]
* Approach: SWAP
* Scope
	* Migrate data
	- Deploy in IT landscape and integrate
	- Setup HR processes
* Go-live: October 6th.
* Implementation partner is Infosys
* The new tool, based on Oracle HCM, is supporting Matrix organizations, allowing for assignments and performance loops based on those.
* The product can do Strategic Resource Management, but we will not implement it this project, since the approach is SWAP. Moreover, to do so, we will need to define better our data.
* In the future there is appetite to explore allocation based on skills and link it with our Training platforms to create professional profiles.
