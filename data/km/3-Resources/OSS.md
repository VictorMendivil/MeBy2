- Refers to a set of software applications and tools that help telecom operators manage, monitor, and control their network infrastructure and services. OSS supports activities such as:
	- Network inventory management
	- Network configuration
	- Service provisioning and activation
	- Fault management and troubleshooting
	- Performance monitoring
	- Network planning and optimization
- OSS works closely with [[BSS]], which handle customer-facing activities like billing and customer relationship management. Together, OSS and BSS form the backbone of a telecom operator's ability to deliver, maintain, and bill for services.
