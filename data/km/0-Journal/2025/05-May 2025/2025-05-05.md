## Worked tasks
* [[Create clarity for the TietoEvry Exit project on Salesforce-CCDW]]

	* I'm contacting [[Vidar Olsen]], as Value Stream Architect, to identify who can help me out with target picture
	* Created subtask [[Identify who is stakeholder for the remaining designs with Mobile Business]]
* [[What is a workshop for NOL]]
	* Got feedback from [[Tor Henrik]], and shared it with [[Bente]]
	* Closing the task
* [[Define scope for outcomes and presentation to NOL on June]]
	* We take the already shared presentation as starting point: [https://telenorgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/bente_busch_telenor_no/ETQL2DIH0SRElhZRYzNm28IBfULRvAZOrRVpW0OSnLV51A?e=RxpIEG](https://telenorgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/bente_busch_telenor_no/ETQL2DIH0SRElhZRYzNm28IBfULRvAZOrRVpW0OSnLV51A?e=RxpIEG)
	* We need to create more visibility on the value generated by exploiting data and automation (part of Torbjorn's request)
	* Selecting a few use cases which can create end-to-end value (across Value Streams), building some of the foundational pieces (or requisites) we need (Competence, Culture, Tools and Platforms, Data Availability, Governance)
	* As we will not build all foundational pieces for the initial use cases, we can iterate a few times more, looking to incrementally provide those pieces plus creating business value
	* Should do we target some of the foundational pieces we believe we need? or are they going to come depending on the use case selected? (the later can make building a roadmap very difficult)
* [[Co-create presentation about Data, Insight and AI driven Telenor Norway in June]]
	* Prepared a presentation outlining how the roadmap may look like: [Roadmap - playing with scenarios.pptx](https://telenorgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/victor_mendivil_telenor_no/EWVvWCVNeeRLoRNC3Pei-_MB2OOmIOLNwhE8GTF6BS6puw?e=pc9wOq)
