## Parking lot
## Meetings and interactions
- WS6 debrief - Strategy & TMO #areas/collaborate_within_tmo  #meeting 
	- Presented report about Business Opportunities to [[NOL]]
		- Effects were high because divisions played unconstrained
		- It was clear during the session that the focus is 2026 OPEX
		- More work expected in the coming days and weeks
		- We still don't see the OPEX effects from TietoEvry Exit
		- All of these conversations are leading towards an important discussion on workforce. After so many investments, where are the efficiencies?
- TietoEvry Exit-FKM #projects/tieto_evry_exit_cvc  #meeting 
	- Met [[Lars-Erik]]
	- Spoke about [[FKM system]], task [[Talk with Lars-Erik about the level of risk in FKM]]
	- [x] [[Share with TMO the feedback about too much management reporting]] #projects/tieto_evry_exit_cvc ✅ 2025-06-20
	- [x] [[Share with TMO about IT struggle to drive modernization from technical teams]] #areas/collaborate_within_tmo ✅ 2025-06-20
- TiE exit: Meet Gartner Mainframe Experts #projects/tieto_evry_exit_cvc  #meeting 
	- Met [[Ola Horten]], [[Vidar Olsen]], [[Knut Harald Graven]], [[Cesar Pinto]], and the Gartner team
	- Gartner team
		- Martina is mainframe application expert
		- Paul is mainframe infrastructure expert
		- Gen Ingen is Managing Partner for Consultancy
		- Mattias is leading transformations out of mainframes
	- They haven't seen an organization doing this in less than two years
	- Emulation is highly unrecommended - we will need to migrate parts of the code or libraries
	- Insourcing is possible, but unrealistic. Personnel could be found if we pay enough but will impact the transformation due to the same people working in two projects at the same time
	- Of all options presented, Gartner feels the option 2 is more feasible (outsource), and, if possible, insource mission critical applications
- Review of storyline for NOL presentation  #projects/AI_task_force  #meeting 
	- We should group Business Opportunities around value drivers
	- The following sequence is a better flow for the story
		- Value to capture
		- Challenges ahead
		- Key activities coming
	- Slide 22: it should include AS-IS and TO-BE in the same slide
	- The roadmap should be more detailed and include outcomes
	- Break opportunities into value items/drops or whatever

	- Collected names
	- Almost finished. We're waiting only for [[Anders Sorskar]]'s answer
