## Meetings and interactions
- Use case prioritisation and selection #projects/AI_task_force  #meeting 
	- Met [[DIAI team]]
	- There is a number of Value Streams for which [[Sonja Helena Jaegersborg]] has identified problems to solve. Those are: [[Assurance Value Stream]], [[Internet@home Value Stream]], [[Entertainment Value Stream]], and the [[Billing domain]]
	- I proposed to either explore wider or take one and explore deeper
		- The team proposed to explore deeper one area
	- I advised to take the path of less resistance
		- The team was, somewhat,  convinced to go for [[Assurance Value Stream]], due to their ownership, motivation, and their problems being cross-Value Stream

	- Met [[John Gustav]]
	- Expected outcomes:

		- Achieve a high degree of modernization 
	- However, the first outcome is much more important
	- We haven't had the time to consider what to modernize
	- Aligned with CVC on focusing in timelines rather than modernization
	- The ultima goal is not clear, but assumed. Faster time to market
	- CEO has given marching order
