## Parking lot
## Meetings and interactions
- Global Brand Introduction #areas/line_management  #meeting 
	- Invited by [[Kaja Dyrdahl]]
	- The brand is unique across all [[Business Unit]]s
	- Brand value for [[Telenor group]] is 18%, and trending down
		- Telcos often score low on brand value
	- The [[Brand Design Toolkit]] is our option of choice to bring consistency in our interactions, both internally and externally
- Monetization - Dynamic billing for a commercial opportunity  #projects/billing  #meeting 
	- Attendees: [[Magdalena]], [[Vidar Olsen]], [[Lars Hervig]], [[Olav Gøsta Østensen]]
	- Part of [[Decision on piloting dynamic pricing for a tender process]]
	- Our solution doesn't look capable of supporting what Business needs
	- After some conversation, it became clear we should identify key use cases so they can assess the architecture feasibility
		- The use cases also should include some account for when it may be needed
	- In addition, we should understand what are the constraints
		- Software
		- Geographies
- Exit COS og CCDW #projects/tieto_evry_exit_cvc  #meeting 
	- Technical people were skeptical about event-driven architecture and unsynchronous integrations
	- Actually, they talked about replicated the same technique we have in database triggers in the future solution, bypassing the business logic
	- Surprisingly enough, some voices would prefer the more monolith capabilities to aggregate data easier
		- This looks more like the micro-services and/or APIs are poorly designed
	- I decided to speak with [[Lars-Erik]] and give feedback to [[Vidar Olsen]] to try understanding a bit more the context because this is, obviously, against the CIO's vision
- TF Mainframe - Follow-up and SteerCo alignment  #projects/tieto_evry_exit_cvc  #meeting 
	- Part of work to build alternatives to migrate mainframes
	- [x] [[Build alternatives to migrate Mainframes]] #projects/tieto_evry_exit_cvc ✅ 2025-06-06
	- It seems the capacity needed to operate the platform ourselves would be around 10 to 15 FTE
	- We need a 24x7 service, with shifts
	- This includes Infrastructure plus Application Operations
	- There are three options on the table:
		- Build our own Mainframe
		- Buy from [[Kyndryl]]
		- Emulation
	- [[Christoffer Vestrheim]] has requested me to help with the cost picture, urgently
		- Provide TCO for the three alternatives to migrating Mainframes
- Misc points #projects/onboading  #meeting 
	- Met [[Katrina Sponheim]]
	- Worked on [[Consider how to take the hypothesis about resistance to autonomy]]
	- She clarified that the lack of autonomy is actually business leadership being prescriptive about what to do and when to do it. They're output oriented and order the team to do actions, rather than letting the team figure out what to do

## Worked tasks
- [[Decision on piloting dynamic pricing for a tender process]]
	- Competition is fierce. Large organizations purchase SIMs and MBs, making it difficult to bring forward our differentiating offering
	- However, for mission critical areas, we have an opportunity to change this model and also bring our differentiating offering to the forefront
	- For doing this, we need to be able to model our price as the hyperscalers
		- Pricing based on resources used from our platforms
		- Price reductions make a competitive entry price, increasing for large uses
		- Price parameters are objective and measured on transactions against our network, transport layers, databases and services
		- Assets are priced differently based on quality, SLA or configuration
