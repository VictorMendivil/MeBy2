## Parking lot
## Meetings and interactions
- 1to1 Tor Henrik <> Victor #areas/contribute_success_IT  #meeting 
	- Talked with [[Tor Henrik]] about resistance from [[IT division]] related to the transformation contribution
	- Basically he suggested me to move to the [[IT division]], as he doesn't believe the culture may change any time soon
## Worked tasks
- Reading "Data Management Is the Sole Differentiator in a Commoditized and Multipolar LLM World" #areas/learning 
	- Coming from [[Data Management Is the Sole Differentiator in a Commoditized and Multipolar LLM World]]
	- [[LLM]]'s are not differentiators anymore due to the ever increasing number of implementation
		- LLM's are not based on proprietary and non-disclosed knowledge, but are based on public knowledge and algorithms 
		- A game changer is when a company publishes its LLM in Open Source, especially if the implementation is not power hungry during the training process. It seems [[DeepSeek R1]] has achieved that
	- According to [[Gartner]] the key differentiators will be around corporate's data, and the ability to utilize its assets effectively
		- [[Data annotation]]
		- [[RAG]] 
		- [[Semantic management]]
		- [[Active metadata]]
	- Value pyramid for Enterprise Data and AI Platforms
		- ![[Pasted image 20250703125021.png]]
- [[Assist more proactively the TietoEvry Exit]]
	- Read document about Nitra to NIMS
	- I just wonder why the approach is too sequential - looks like exploratory can help more, since there are so many uncertainties
	- Sharing the timeline and highlighting it has a high degree on uncertainty is a self-fulling prophecy. I wonder why they share a timeline which is not feasible
	- I think I need to read it again tomorrow, because is not easy to spot where to help
		- Perhaps the best would be to offer my help to the project team?
- [[Co-create presentation about Data, Insight and AI driven Telenor Norway in June]]
	- Worked on the slides
	- I added the one from DNA, but it wools to general for being of real use. I asked [[Bente]] if she would like to drop it, and asked [[Sajjad]] for more info in just one case
	- Worked a bit more on the distribution of labor
