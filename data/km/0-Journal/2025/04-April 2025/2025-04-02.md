## Parking lot
## Meetings and interactions
### [[NOL]] debrief #meeting  #areas/collaborate_within_tmo 
* Created [[COS system]]
### Gartner interaction #meeting  #areas/learning 
* There is research on how long does it take for an organization to become proficient in the value stream operating models
	* It requires patience to see the benefits. We're talking about 5 to 8 years.
	* It's key to quantify the journey / track the transformation. It's not only about productivity, but rather maturity. The most mature players get the benefit of the operating model
	* There is an interesting setup which is creating value (Adobe implemented it)
		* The concept pivots around defining Minimum Viable Teams with as much as possible capacity out of those, which becomes flexible
		* Then, an organization allocates that flexible capacity around
		* They have been able to achieve up to 40% cost reduction thanks to this setup
* An interesting suggestion: what if the horizontals assign its capacity to the verticals? 
## Worked tasks
