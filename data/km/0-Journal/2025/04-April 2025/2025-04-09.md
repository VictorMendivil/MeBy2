## Parking lot
* Created [[Norwegian Communications Authority (NKOM)]]
* Created [[Electronic Communication Services (EKOM)]]
## Meetings and interactions
* FW: CVC Advisory Board #meeting  #projects/tieto_evry_exit_cvc 
	* Presented to Advisory Board and my feeling is that it went ok - but not awesome
	* Had the feeling they're behind something in particular, and not interested in all the City Plan - sort of confirmed by [[Karl Pedersen]], present in the meeting
	* The things they cared about the most
		* Reusability (with examples) and collaboration across Value Streams
		* Don't make Value Stream Leaders work in material which has been already produced (e.g., Borough Plans include a section for Business Opportunities)
		* Should the Value Stream Leaders own anything, they should be part of the creation process - in relation to Borough Plan
	* Actions on my name
		* [x] [[Bring examples of cross Value Stream collaboration and reuse]] #projects/tieto_evry_exit_cvc ‚è´ ‚úÖ 2025-05-06
		* [x] [[Take a look into 'governance' across Value Streams. How do we make sure there is collaboration]] #projects/tieto_evry_exit_cvc ‚úÖ 2025-06-02
		* [x] [[Seat with Value Stream Leaders to adjust Borough Plan template avoiding duplication of content]] #projects/tieto_evry_exit_cvc ‚úÖ 2025-06-02
* Insight and AI intensive Business objectives in [[Internet@home Value Stream]] #meeting  #projects/AI_task_force 
	* They are looking to increase revenue, basically
		* They wish to become smarter offering products, so segmenting customer is key. That means using better our data
			* Example: start using age as segmentation parameter
		* They started looking into house security - how to make our customers safe at home
			* Data from routers is used for technical purposes today, however it can be used for much more
			* Making this data available is challenging because the data owners are from technology, and they have other priorities and visibility
		* They miss self-serving capabilities (e.g., sales reports per area)
		* In this area the game is data insights
	* There is another area looking for radical simplification
		* They wish for a better integration with other horizontals (e.g., Assurance)
		* They claim bringing all data (including [[Electronic Communication Services (EKOM)]]) together and put AI on top can unleash lot more of automation possibilities (e.g., it can propose the segmentations automatically)
* Digital Transformation-Onboarding-Feedback from [[Mobile business Value Stream]] #meeting  #projects/onboading 
	* Conversation with [[Nikolai Perminow]]
	* Part of [[Get to known Nikolai views on IT-related opportunities, challenges and risks]]
	* Closed task [[Get to known Nikolai views on IT-related opportunities, challenges and risks]]
