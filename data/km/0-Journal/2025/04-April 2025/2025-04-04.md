## Meetings and interactions
### CoP arch #meeting  #projects/tieto_evry_exit_cvc 
* My concern related to architecture activities grew today. The Architects are very concerned about lack of clarity on their roles, the governance, who takes decisions.
* On top, it seems Architects are addressing topics which they should not address. An example is the question on how many headcounts we may be able to reduce after the migration out of Tieto Evry
