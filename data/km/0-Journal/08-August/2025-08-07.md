## Parking lot
## Meetings and interactions
- Onboarding with IT - Session 2 - 1st hour #areas/line_management  #meeting 
	- Part of [[Onboard Ludwig into IT]]
	- Met [[Torbjorn]], [[Ludwig]], [[Lars-Erik]], [[Katrina Sponheim]], [[Bente]], [[Ola Horten]]
	- Presentation on Order Value Chain was good and clear
	- On AI, some of the work we can do is around orchestrating, gaining visibility and share learnings
	- Relevant for [[Agree on a mandate for the Transformation office in Data Decentralization]]
		- [[Bente]] is confident her Value Stream can identify front-runners and deliver what is expected, and suggested the [[Strategy and Transformation Office]] may focus on AI
		- While [[Torbjorn]] asked to collaborate together
		- [[Ludwig]] suggested to bring the [[Business Opportunities]], and then ask the owners how to accelerate
		- [[Bente]] acknowledged she has not managed to have the talk with [[Value Stream Leader community]] to be motivated to the journey
		- My impression on this whole conversation is a misalignment between [[Bente]] and [[Torbjorn]], now for some time, in which the later strongly points to collaboration and work together, while the former feels confident to deliver alone and not willing to open up the work
		- After discussing with [[Ludwig]], there are several lines to explore, which I placed in [[Agree on a mandate for the Transformation office in Data Decentralization]]
	- Closing task

## Worked tasks
- [[Agree on a mandate for the Transformation office in Data Decentralization]]
	- [[Ludwig]] lens: prefers small wins before than big but later wins, not fan of culture change (right now), shy of focusing much outside [[Telenor Norway]]
	- [[Bente]] lens: wants help with culture change, is not targeting domain knowledge
	- [[Torbjorn]]: wants help, he would like the company to become data-driven
	- Conclusion and actions
		- We should retake the conversation with Bente and Ludwig in terms of how the [[Strategy and Transformation Office]] can assist
		- Most likely scenario would be to deploy domain knowledge - we haven't asked if the domains want help!
		- Automation may be another one, but more should be explored
		- Developing solutions across Value streams could be another area
		- Connection with [[Telenor Nordics]] is something I should leave [[Sajjad]] to help me with, but is not a priority
		- Development productivity is another space to further investigate
		- Finally, let [[P&C units]] and [[P&O division]] do the culture change 
- [[Co-create presentation about Data, Insight and AI driven Telenor Norway in June]]
