Dear Dan,

As you already know from our previous conversations, there is a possibility that our system migrations out of the mainframe may not be completed by the end of 2026. Should such a scenario materialize, we would need to consider our available options.

One alternative we may need to explore is extending our current services beyond 2026.

Given that prices have increased significantly in recent years, we would like to better understand what is involved in providing these services. Our goal is to become more familiar with the complexity, so we can properly evaluate and consider alternatives for a possible extension.

To ensure we have sufficient time to assess our options, make decisions, and execute accordingly, we believe it is important to start this process as soon as possible.

Could you please help us by providing information on the following topics, which will assist us in sizing the effort required to continue running these services?

Thank you very much for your support and understanding. We appreciate your cooperation as we navigate this together.

Best regards,
