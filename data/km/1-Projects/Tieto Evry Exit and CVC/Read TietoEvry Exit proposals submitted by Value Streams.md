## Reflections
* Remarks
	* In my quick assessment, I would put focus in
		* [[Recon system]]
		* all in [[TietoEvry Exit - Being analyzed]]
		* [[Marius system]] due to the number of target systems containing pieces of Marius, and the inability to re-use CVC
		* [[CCDW system]] due to its connections all around
		* [[FKM system]] because the team believes so
		* [[Nitra system]] because is ancient and knowledge is lost
