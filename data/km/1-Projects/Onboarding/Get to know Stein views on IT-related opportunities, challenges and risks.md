## Reflections
* Related to [[Entertainment Value Stream]]
- How satisfied are you with the services provided by the Value Streams owned by IT?
	* Primarily working with the people lent by IT, and not so much aware of the delivery from the IT Value Streams
- How satisfied are you with the capacity and competence provided by the IT P&C, and your relationship with this area
	* They are transforming business models and are received adequate competence
	* When decided to move to VS, it was quick and satisfying experience working with IT, as they received  good competence.
	* P&C has been good partner; when IT reached their resource constraints, they were very clear, which was fair.
	* They have the dilemma about modernization (which can take an additional 10 IT FTE) versus transformation ambitions. However, from a different angle, adding 10 IT people will not do the trick because Entertainment would then lack attention/bandwidth and they will have competing priorities. Modernization, at the current pace, can take many years.
- How likely are you to recommend the IT setup, from a scale from 0 to 10?
	* Been in Telenor for 5 years, and the previous setup was a disaster.
	* Now the business is closer to IT, and vice versa. There is transparency.
	* Having an Architect in the leadership team is effective, as we now think customer-oriented.
