- How satisfied are you with the capacity and competence provided by the IT P&C, and your relationship with this area?
	- There are very few people working for the Value Stream today
	- This Value Stream is managing the mainframes with IT capacity. However Rolf believes mainframes should be with IT, since there is no common interactions between the mainframe teams and the rest of the Value Stream.
	- There is need to re-skill and re-imagine the Value Stream. More development capabilities should be added progressively
	- For capacity, they connect with their own P&C, not with IT P&C
- How satisfied are you with the services provided by the Value Streams owned by IT?
	- Collaborating with Cloud Value Stream and to some extend with Shared Application Services Value Stream
	- However they need some automation with AI, so Shared Data Services connection should happen
	- He observes the message of collaborating across doesn't have the same weight than "autonomy"
- How likely are you to recommend the IT setup from a scale from 0 to 10?
	- He is promoter
	- It's important having the power to execute on your mission, so empowerment of the Operating Model is good
	- Some downsides:
		- It divides competence and activities
		- Scalability depends too much on individuals, not in the system
