- Input given to AI
	- I've been running interviews within my organization to understand what is their perspective about the IT setup. Our organization is operating with a Value Stream setup, with IT embedded into business. I would like to ask you different questions later on about the interviews. For the time being, hereunder the content of those interviews:
	- 1. Interview with Mobile Business Value Stream This is a Vertical Value Stream. It belongs to the Business Division. This is the interview content: - How satisfied are you with the services provided by the Value Streams owned by IT? * Satisfied with the digital workplace, although wondering why do we need to decommission some of the great tools available, like Mural * Channel tools are dragging us. It was our decision to postpone modernization. * It is difficult to handle the priorities between growth and modernization * In [[BSS]] we have opportunities to modernize. Event-driven architecture is a big progress and opportunity for us. * Network. Happy to see steps in the right direction, with network as a service. Good signs. * Unfortunately, when we created buffers during growth or modernization, we decided not to use them to modernize, losing the opportunity. Example: after a business improvement which made 1 or 2 headcounts redundant, we reported a saving, rather than using the improvement to invest in modernization - How satisfied are you with the capacity and competence provided by the IT P&C, and your relationship with this area * In general the development competence is good, when we get them * Long time to fill gaps hiring people. He hints the future downsizing may be the issue (in his view) * Large competence variations between teams (e.g., Nova is cutting-edge and Analytics is improving since last year) * It's not IT's fault not to have enough capacity in the Value Streams. Redistributing capacity is old-fashion and doesn't allow for rapid reallocation. * Maybe if IT costs would be in the Value Streams, it would be better because then the Value Stream Leaders will be able to defend headcounts with the Business Opportunities. Headcount reductions in IT can harm more the business. - How likely are you to recommend the IT setup, from a scale from 0 to 10? * 6 to 7. He's not a detractor * The divisional structure doesn't help. * In general, there are many people in the horizontals. More balancing is needed. * Also, from an accountability point of view, the verticals are limited (e.g., Salesforce) * He is not detractor of [[Value Driven Operating Model (VDOM)]] but more can be done * He is not detractor of [[Value Driven Operating Model (VDOM)]] but more can be done 2. Interview with Internet @ Home Value Stream This is a Vertical Value Stream. It belongs to the Consumer division This is the interview content: * PROS * There is specific competence in the Consumer division which, when put together, create enhanced data-related solution * The Value Stream is promoter of the IT competence delivered by [[IT P&C]] * Room for improvement * The Value Stream is lacking capacity and competence to be able to capitalize on the data and tools available (e.g., be able to use AI to have tailored journeys per customer) * Difficulty to balance modernization (TietoEvry Exit) versus the data journey * Test our data journey while doing modernization can be key going forward * Would it be possible to socialize more our experiences and successes in data? * When a Value Stream delivers a new tool, they should own more the outcomes, not only rolling-out the tool * More capacity should move from Horizontal Value Streams to Vertical Value Streams * External requests (from other Value Streams) are impacting their ability to deliver, as there are too many dependencies from Horizontal Value Streams (in particular, from platforms) 3. Interview with Assurance Value Stream This is a Horizontal Value Stream. It belongs to the Technology division This is the interview content: - How satisfied are you with the services provided by the Value Streams owned by IT? * There are two main apps they care about * [[Octo system]] * [[Alfa app]] * [[Authority Request system]] * They seems to be satisfied with the digital landscape available to them * Private Cloud is an area of concern - How satisfied are you with the capacity and competence provided by the IT P&C, and your relationship with this area * They are very satisfied with the collaboration with [[IT P&C]]. There is good dialogue. * Seems to be happy, in general. * We can improve on functions. E.g., system ownership; legacy apps which are cross Value Stream. IT would like to move personnel to the Value Stream, but still people will need to serve several Value Streams * Interesting learning: [[Marius system]] takes a long term view on capacity allocation, which pays in good dialogue and proactiveness towards [[IT P&C]]. It works really well. - How likely are you to recommend the IT setup, from a scale from 0 to 10? * Promoter (9 or 10) * They believe the model works great due to flexibility/mobility and competence available * Flexibility example: a person lost his/her security clearance and was replaced rather fast * Maybe improvable: most dependable leaders reporting to Value Stream. However, it may not work 4. Interview with Entertainment Value Stream This is a Vertical Value Stream. It belongs to the Consumer division This is the interview content: - How satisfied are you with the services provided by the Value Streams owned by IT? * Primarily working with the people lent by IT, and not so much aware of the delivery from the IT Value Streams - How satisfied are you with the capacity and competence provided by the IT P&C, and your relationship with this area * They are transforming business models and are received adequate competence * When decided to move to VS, it was quick and satisfying experience working with IT, as they received good competence. * P&C has been good partner; when IT reached their resource constraints, they were very clear, which was fair. * They have the dilemma about modernization (which can take an additional 10 IT FTE) versus transformation ambitions. However, from a different angle, adding 10 IT people will not do the trick because Entertainment would then lack attention/bandwidth and they will have competing priorities. Modernization, at the current pace, can take many years. - How likely are you to recommend the IT setup, from a scale from 0 to 10? * Been in Telenor for 5 years, and the previous setup was a disaster. * Now the business is closer to IT, and vice versa. There is transparency. * Having an Architect in the leadership team is effective, as we now think customer-oriented. 5. Interview with Safe and worryfree Value Stream This is a Vertical Value Stream. It belongs to the Consumer division This is the interview content: * PROS * They have done some modernization and it's still challenging to continue, although is manageable * Developed the [[HERO]] product as part of [[CVC]] * They're promoter of the way of working ([[0-VDOM 2_plus]]) and [[IT P&C]] * Very important to have Technical Leaders and the Value Stream Architecture * Room for improvement * Challenges to get access to some systems, but not big issues so far * Discovering some issues to get hold on data, but still don't have a conclusion. They're very busy. * It takes time to get used to work in [[0-VDOM 2_plus]] * Clarify and be able to broad roles, so the team doesn't need to always add capacity 6. Interview with Wholesale Value Stream This is a Vertical Value Stream. It belongs to the Wholesale division This is the interview content: - How satisfied are you with the services provided by the Value Streams owned by IT? * They don't have much to do with the horizontals * Focusing in end of life for several of the apps * The rely on their Value Stream Architect to bridge with the IT Value Streams * They are interested into connecting with Shared Data Services because Data represents an opportunity for them - How satisfied are you with the capacity and competence provided by the IT P&C, and your relationship with this area * Working with IT P&C to get people working on moving to CVC * A person working a lot with data, as they have strong reporting requirements, even regulatory * Early to answer in full as they are ramping up the teams * It seems we have the right competence but not the right capacity * Journey to learn the area for the new people * Capacity seems too low * More capacity is difficult to be allocated because IT doesn't know yet what needs to be done * Dilemma between modernization and growth - How likely are you to recommend the IT setup, from a scale from 0 to 10? * Wholesale is a promoter of the current setup * More access to IT capacity than ever * Enabled Wholesale to do more. Now people are really assigned * Example: we were able to deliver a temporary solution to the market from 20215, but now they can do it * VS Architect is an asset * Closer to business * They would like to have the opportunity to scale up the organization to get the best out of the setup, but is not possible at the moment * They don't have all resources to do it themselves because there are many dependencies * Some IT tasks on the IT side, example: a mobile operator as a customer. It takes a while to get work done outside of the value stream (billing, Datawarehouse, IROD) 7. Interview with Customer Operations Value Stream This is a Horizontal Value Stream. It belongs to the Consumer division This is the interview content: - How satisfied are you with the outcomes provided by the Value Streams owned by IT? - Other VS are black boxes - there is little information - Very few common arenas for sharing - It could be valuable for them to have a regular presentation on what is going on with the operating model (maybe some opportunities they don't know about) - They believe they need to do everything themselves - It seems there is value in getting more in contact with other Value Streams - - How satisfied are you with the capacity and competence provided by the IT P&C, and your relationship with this area - It was difficult to have the dialogue and get the necessary people - Lack of IT needs - A few months afterwards, the competence is coming - We're almost covered with roles - Is looking good now - There is competition for the IT capacity within the Value Stream as well - Recruitment process has been transparent - Good relationship with IT P&C - In terms of competence it's ok - In some teams (especially the ones from Telenor Labs) have difficulties communicating - They're expecting IT will help balancing the allocation of the people coming from Telenor Labs - Example: allocation in OneView - which is quite key, only have 2 - [ ] Reflect on the above - key systems (Telenor ID) - Very few people are equipped with AI skills - There is the expectation that P&C functions connect and have dialogue - Who gives the performance feedback? is not easy to give feedback for some IT people who have not worked closely with us - Dilemma between modernization versus growth - No one seems to be seeing the totality for our customer or systems - * How likely are you to recommend the current IT setup on a scale from 0 to 10? * Given that we don't have any escalation, they are not dissatisfied * There could be more contact. More guidance and advisory. * 7 to 8 * Neutral * Coaches didn't work as expected 8. Interview with Mobile Consumer Value Stream This is a Vertical Value Stream. It belongs to the Consumer division This is the interview content: - How satisfied are you with the capacity and competence provided by the [[IT P&C]], and your relationship with this area? - Quite happy with the competence and capacity. - Happy about having a Value Stream Architecture in the leadership of the Value Stream. - Working regularly with IT P&C, which allows for quick feedback loops. The organization is responsive. - Good mix between senior skills and junior, which allows for future growth. - Their Value Stream Architect is dealing with two Value Streams, instead of only one. His capacity is stretched but so far working ok. - Balancing modernization and growth is not a struggle because there is a strong prioritization. - How satisfied are you with the services provided by Value Streams owned by IT? - Limited relationship between the Value Stream Owners and the Value Streams owned by IT. - Unclear what are the responsibilities and offering of the IT-owned Value Streams - Technology Value Streams (not IT) have reached out to the Value Stream Owner to explain what they do - The Value Stream Architect is services as bridge between the Mobile Consumer Value Stream and IT-owned Value Streams - They are still trying to figure out how to collaborate - How likely are you to recommend the IT setup, from a scale from 0 to 10? - Neutral (tending towards positive). - The experience overall is positive when it comes to relationship - More proactivity from Value Streams owned by IT is expected - How to create value together - Mixing IT and mobile people together is of great value 9. Interview with Platform and Infrastructure Value Stream This is a Horizontal Value Stream. It belongs to the Technology division This is the interview content: - How satisfied are you with the capacity and competence provided by the IT P&C, and your relationship with this area? - There are very few people working for the Value Stream today - This Value Stream is managing the mainframes with IT capacity. However Rolf believes mainframes should be with IT, since there is no common interactions between the mainframe teams and the rest of the Value Stream. - There is need to re-skill and re-imagine the Value Stream. More development capabilities should be added progressively - For capacity, they connect with their own P&C, not with IT P&C - How satisfied are you with the services provided by the Value Streams owned by IT? - Collaborating with Cloud Value Stream and to some extend with Shared Application Services Value Stream - However they need some automation with AI, so Shared Data Services connection should happen - He observes the message of collaborating across doesn't have the same weight than "autonomy" - How likely are you to recommend the IT setup from a scale from 0 to 10? - He is promoter - It's important having the power to execute on your mission, so empowerment of the Operating Model is good - Some downsides: - It divides competence and activities - Scalability depends too much on individuals, not in the system 10. Interview with Sales and Hardware Solutions Value Stream This is a Vertical Value Stream. It belongs to the Consumer division This is the interview content: - How satisfied are you with the capacity and competence provided by the IT P&C, and your relationship with this area - Already staffed all capacity and competence from IT. The process is quick and accurate. - Good relationship with the IT P&C. - In turn, it's more difficult to increase capacity on the business side. - There is good connection between goals and teams. - The challenge is Business Opportunity process, which prioritizes transformation above running business (or business as usual) - NOL sees more the Business Opportunities than the running business, and that is especially true for sales channels. - Sales channels, in similar fashion than horizontal Value Streams, are asked to reduce costs, however they're enablers for the growth promised by the Product teams in Vertical Value Streams - The Business Opportunity process should consider how to integrate running the business - How satisfied are you with the services provided by the Value Streams owned by IT? - Satisfied with Value Stream Architect - They are aware of the IT Value Streams. Examples: they know about Geneva (for billing), or OneView - However, they are not aware of Shared Data Services - How likely are you to recommend the IT setup, from a scale from 0 to 10? - Tending between neutral and positive - Positive due to the high level of integration of IT people into the Value Stream - Neutral because the IT owned Value Streams are not proactive enough
- Analysis
	- Let us start with an analytical view on it. Can you give me three to four highlights per question? with highlight I mean topics which are recurrent across (recurrent, is at least 50% of the Value Streams mention the topic)
		- [[interview_analysis]]
	- I need you to reason. What would be the root causes for the highlighted issues and how to solve them. Use your experience in your interactions with me
		- [[root_cause_analysis]]
		- Looking at your interview data, I can see patterns that reflect common organizational dynamics I've observed in digital transformations. The root causes often stem from the inherent tension between autonomy (which makes Value Streams effective) and coordination (which prevents organizational fragmentation).
			- The most critical insight is that **your Value Stream model is working as designed** - it's creating autonomous, focused teams. But autonomy without coordination mechanisms creates the very problems you're seeing: silos, communication gaps, and resource inefficiencies.
			- The modernization vs. growth dilemma is particularly telling. This suggests your organization may be trapped in what I call the "quarterly growth trap" - where short-term pressures consistently override long-term investments, eventually making future growth harder to achieve.
			- The heavy reliance on Value Stream Architects as bridges indicates you've unconsciously created "human APIs" - single points of integration that work but don't scale. This is a classic pattern when organizations don't design for integration from the start.
			- Three questions for you to consider:
				1. **How are Value Stream leaders currently measured?** If it's purely on their own delivery, that explains the collaboration gaps.
				2. **What's your current ratio of modernization to growth investment?** The interviews suggest it's heavily skewed toward growth.
				3. **Do you have visibility into cross-Value Stream dependencies?** The dependency issues suggest these aren't being managed systematically.
	- How would you consider the level of satisfaction from the Value Streams towards the IT P&C and the competence and capacity given by IT to them?
		- Looking at the interview data, I'd assess the satisfaction with IT P&C capacity and competence as **moderately positive but with significant structural concerns**. Here's my analysis:
		## Overall Satisfaction Level: 6-7 out of 10
		### **Positive Aspects (What's Working Well):**
		**Strong Relationship Quality:** The majority of Value Streams express satisfaction with their relationship with IT P&C:
		- Assurance: "very satisfied with the collaboration"
		- Entertainment: "P&C has been good partner"
		- Mobile Consumer: "quite happy with the competence and capacity"
		- Sales & Hardware: "good relationship with the IT P&C"
		**Competence Quality:** When Value Streams get the right people, they're generally happy with the skill level:
		- Mobile Business: "development competence is good, when we get them"
		- Mobile Consumer: "good mix between senior skills and junior"
		- Entertainment: "received adequate competence"
		**Process Transparency:** Several mention that IT P&C is clear about constraints:
		- Entertainment: "when IT reached their resource constraints, they were very clear, which was fair"
		- Customer Operations: "recruitment process has been transparent"
		### **Significant Concerns (The Structural Issues):**
		**Capacity Constraints are Universal:** This is mentioned by 6 out of 10 Value Streams:
		- Mobile Business: "Long time to fill gaps hiring people"
		- Internet @ Home: "lacking capacity and competence"
		- Wholesale: "right competence but not the right capacity"
		- Customer Operations: "competition for the IT capacity within the Value Stream"
		**The Modernization vs. Growth Trap:** This systemic issue appears in 5 interviews, suggesting it's not just a capacity problem but a prioritization/resource allocation problem at the organizational level.
		**Competence Variations:** Mobile Business notes "large competence variations between teams" and Customer Operations mentions communication difficulties with some teams.
		## Key Insight: The "Good When Available" Pattern
		The most telling pattern is that Value Streams are satisfied with IT P&C **when they can access the capacity they need**, but frustrated by the **systemic constraints** that limit that access. This suggests the issue isn't with IT P&C's capability or approach, but with the organizational model's resource allocation mechanisms.
		## What This Tells Us About Your Operating Model
		1. **IT P&C is doing their job well** - the relationship management and competence delivery are working
		2. **The constraint is structural** - it's about how capacity is allocated across competing priorities
		3. **The problem is organizational** - the modernization vs. growth dilemma appears to be a strategic/financial constraint, not an IT P&C execution issue
		This suggests your improvement focus should be on **organizational capacity planning and strategic prioritization** rather than on IT P&C's operational capabilities. The satisfaction would likely increase significantly if the structural constraints were addressed.
	- How would you analyze and reason the level of satisfaction from the Value Streams towards the Value Streams owned by the IT organization?
		- Looking at the interview data, the satisfaction with IT-owned Value Streams is **significantly lower** than satisfaction with IT P&C - I'd assess it at around **4-5 out of 10**. This is the most problematic area in your entire IT setup.
		## The Core Problem: IT Value Streams are "Black Boxes"
		The most damning pattern is that **business Value Streams don't really know what IT Value Streams do**:
		- **Customer Operations:** "Other VS are black boxes - there is little information"
		- **Mobile Consumer:** "Limited relationship between the Value Stream Owners and the Value Streams owned by IT. Unclear what are the responsibilities and offering of the IT-owned Value Streams"
		- **Sales & Hardware:** "they are not aware of Shared Data Services" (despite being a data-heavy business)
		## Three Critical Gaps
		### 1. **Awareness Gap** (Most Severe)
		Value Streams simply don't know what IT Value Streams offer:
		- No service catalogs or capability presentations
		- No regular touchpoints or showcases
		- IT Value Streams aren't marketing their capabilities internally
		### 2. **Proactivity Gap**
		When there is awareness, the complaint is lack of proactive engagement:
		- **Mobile Consumer:** "More proactivity from Value Streams owned by IT is expected - How to create value together"
		- **Sales & Hardware:** "IT owned Value Streams are not proactive enough"
		- **Customer Operations:** "More guidance and advisory" needed
		### 3. **Value Demonstration Gap**
		IT Value Streams aren't connecting their work to business outcomes:
		- **Internet @ Home:** "When a Value Stream delivers a new tool, they should own more the outcomes, not only rolling-out the tool"
		## The Structural Root Cause
		**IT Value Streams are operating in "Service Provider" mode, not "Business Partner" mode.** They're:
		- Waiting to be asked rather than proactively identifying opportunities
		- Delivering capabilities without ensuring business value realization
		- Not investing in relationship building with business Value Streams
		## Comparison: IT P&C vs IT Value Streams
		## The Business Impact
		This low satisfaction creates a **vicious cycle**:
		1. Business Value Streams don't know what IT Value Streams offer
		2. They don't engage with IT Value Streams
		3. IT Value Streams become more isolated and less business-relevant
		4. Business Value Streams try to build everything themselves or go external
		5. IT Value Streams become even less connected to business value
		## Critical Insight: Your Model is Missing the "Product Management" Layer
		IT Value Streams seem to lack **product management mindset**. They're building capabilities but not:
		- Understanding customer (internal business) needs
		- Marketing their capabilities internally
		- Measuring adoption and business value
		- Iterating based on business feedback
		## Recommendations for Immediate Action
		1. **IT Value Stream "Roadshows"** - Monthly presentations where each IT Value Stream showcases capabilities to business Value Streams
		2. **Service Catalogs** - Clear documentation of what each IT Value Stream offers and how to engage them
		3. **Business Liaison Roles** - Embed business-oriented people in IT Value Streams to bridge the gap
		4. **Value Metrics** - IT Value Streams should measure and report business impact, not just technical delivery
		This is your biggest opportunity for improvement - the gap between current satisfaction (4-5/10) and potential satisfaction is enormous if you can solve the awareness and proactivity problems.
	- Summarizing, would the Value Streams recommend the IT setup?
		## Summary: Would Value Streams Recommend the IT Setup?
		**Short Answer: Cautiously Yes, but with Reservations** - The overall sentiment is **neutral to mildly positive (6-7 out of 10)**, but this masks significant underlying issues.
		## The Recommendation Breakdown
		### **Promoters (3 Value Streams - 30%)**
		- **Assurance** (9-10): "believe the model works great due to flexibility/mobility and competence available"
		- **Wholesale**: "More access to IT capacity than ever" and "Enabled Wholesale to do more"
		- **Platform & Infrastructure**: Values "empowerment to execute on your mission"
		### **Neutral/Conditional (6 Value Streams - 60%)**
		- **Mobile Business** (6-7): "He's not a detractor" but sees structural issues
		- **Customer Operations** (7-8): "Given that we don't have any escalation, they are not dissatisfied"
		- **Mobile Consumer**: "Neutral (tending towards positive)" - likes relationships but wants more proactivity
		- **Sales & Hardware**: "Tending between neutral and positive" - appreciates integration but wants more from IT Value Streams
		- **Entertainment**: Positive compared to previous disaster, but has concerns
		- **Safe and Worryfree**: "Promoter of the way of working" but acknowledges challenges
		### **No Clear Detractors (0%)**
		Notably, no Value Stream is actively recommending against the setup.
		## What This Means
		### **The Good News:**
		1. **The model isn't broken** - no one wants to go back to the old way
		2. **Strong foundation exists** - relationships with IT P&C are working well
		3. **Integration benefits are recognized** - business and IT working together is valued
		### **The Concerning Reality:**
		4. **Lukewarm endorsement** - 6-7/10 suggests "it's okay" rather than "it's great"
		5. **Conditional satisfaction** - most recommendations come with significant "but..." statements
		6. **Untapped potential** - many see what it could be but aren't experiencing it fully
		## The Key Pattern: "It's Better Than Before, But..."
		The sentiment is: _"This is an improvement over traditional IT, and we wouldn't go back, but we're not experiencing the full potential of what this model could deliver."_
		## Three Critical Gaps Preventing Higher Recommendations:
		7. **IT Value Streams underperforming** - The biggest drag on overall satisfaction
		8. **Collaboration mechanisms missing** - Value Streams operating in silos
		9. **Strategic prioritization challenges** - The modernization vs. growth dilemma
		## Strategic Implication
		**You have a stable foundation but significant headroom for improvement.** The neutral-positive sentiment suggests your organization is in the "it works but could be much better" zone - which is actually a good position to be in for driving improvement initiatives.
		The fact that you have promoters (proving the model can work excellently) and no detractors (showing the foundation is sound) means you have a strong platform to build upon. The key is addressing the specific gaps that are preventing the 60% neutral group from becoming promoters.
		**Bottom line:** Value Streams would recommend the setup over alternatives, but with the caveat that significant improvements are needed to unlock its full potential.
