## Reflections
* Related to [[Internet@home Value Stream]]
* PROS
	* There is specific competence in the Consumer division which, when put together, create enhanced data-related solution
	* The Value Stream is promoter of the IT competence delivered by [[IT P&C]]
* Room for improvement
	* The Value Stream is lacking capacity and competence to be able to capitalize on the data and tools available (e.g., be able to use AI to have tailored journeys per customer)
	* Difficulty to balance modernization (TietoEvry Exit) versus the data journey
	* Test our data journey while doing modernization can be key going forward
		* Would it be possible to socialize more our experiences and successes in data?
	* When a Value Stream delivers a new tool, they should own more the outcomes, not only rolling-out the tool
	* More capacity should move from Horizontal Value Streams to Vertical Value Streams
	* External requests (from other Value Streams) are impacting their ability to deliver, as there are too many dependencies from Horizontal Value Streams (in particular, from platforms)
