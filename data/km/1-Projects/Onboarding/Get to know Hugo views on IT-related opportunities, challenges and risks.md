## Reflections
 - How satisfied are you with the services provided by the Value Streams owned by IT?
	* They don't have much to do with the horizontals
	* Focusing in end of life for several of the apps
	* The rely on their Value Stream Architect to bridge with the IT Value Streams
	* They are interested into connecting with Shared Data Services because Data represents an opportunity for them
- How satisfied are you with the capacity and competence provided by the IT P&C, and your relationship with this area
	* Working with IT P&C to get people working on moving to CVC
	* A person working a lot with data, as they have strong reporting requirements, even regulatory
	* Early to answer in full as they are ramping up the teams
	* It seems we have the right competence but not the right capacity
		* Journey to learn the area for the new people
		* Capacity seems too low
		* More capacity is difficult to be allocated because IT doesn't know yet what needs to be done
	* Dilemma between modernization and growth
- How likely are you to recommend the IT setup, from a scale from 0 to 10?
	* Wholesale is a promoter of the current setup
	* More access to IT capacity than ever
	* Enabled Wholesale to do more. Now people are really assigned 
		* Example: we were able to deliver a temporary solution to the market from 20215, but now they can do it
	* VS Architect is an asset
		* Closer to business
	* They would like to have the opportunity to scale up the organization to get the best out of the setup, but is not possible at the moment
	* They don't have all resources to do it themselves because there are many dependencies
	* Some IT tasks on the IT side, example: a mobile operator as a customer. It takes a while to get work done outside of the value stream (billing, Datawarehouse, IROD)
