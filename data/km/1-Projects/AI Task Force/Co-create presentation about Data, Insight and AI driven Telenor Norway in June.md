## Content to include
* The use cases are illustrative. The value is delivered from the Value Streams, as they're accountable for the Value Creation. We use the use cases to exemplify the journey
## Reflections
- 2025-05-06
	- There are building blocks which we can start for the whole Telenor Norway, not only for the audience in the use case
		- Meaning there are two levels of presentation: one overall for Telenor Norway, and another for the use case
- 2025-06-03
	- Gave a holistic review to all the presentation
	- I holt back on the slide order; I see potential to improve if we move some of the background slides somewhere else (Others investing in AI, the staircase, and success stories)
