## Overview
After considerable conversations with [[Cesar Pinto]], we have found two potential collaboration areas:
* Assistance with Operating Model, especially around items which we miss (coordination across, governance)
* Data journey
While it can give me more tools to perform my duties, it also represents a cost which is difficult to justify considering the current situation in the company. Hence, I would like to put this to [[Ragnar]] consideration and decide if I can get a license to utilize their services.
## Goals

## Members
* [[Cesar Pinto]], from [[Gartner]], and myself
